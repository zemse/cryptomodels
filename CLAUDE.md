This is monorepo for hackathon project https://ethglobal.com/events/hackmoney2026/prizes

## Projects

- yellow-build-example is a very simple standalone app to interact with yellow, it is not used in
other part of app.
- cli TBD
- frontend TBD


## Using skills

- Whenever working with technologies like yellow, ENS, consult first with the local skill file.
- The skill files are present inside the skills directory with name of the technology.
- The file might be huge, and various aspects of technology might be segregated using markdown
headings. First see the tree and then read relevant part accordingly.
- Web links might be present, use them if we need to expand on the context.

## Updating Skills

- During development we learn something new in the technology then add a note in the respective file.
- If we run into some gotchas, then we need to add notes in those skills file for future reference.  
- Keep skill files optimised for LLM reading, properly segregated using markdown headings.
- Keep skill files content packed, we do not need unnessary things in it.
- Include weblinks incase LLM needs to expand on the context.
