# Yellow Network Documentation

## Overview

Yellow Network is a decentralized clearing and settlement protocol built on state channels. It enables high-frequency, low-cost off-chain transactions with blockchain-level security.

**Current Version:** 0.5.x

## Key Concepts

- **Nitrolite Protocol**: A state channel protocol enabling off-chain interactions with minimal on-chain operations
- **ClearNode**: Infrastructure for managing cleared transactions and settling disputes
- **State Channels**: Off-chain mechanisms for instant transactions between participants
- **EVM Compatibility**: Initially targets Ethereum Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks

## What Yellow Solves

- **Scaling**: Moving frequent operations away from the blockchain
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reducing on-chain transactions and associated expenses
- **Speed**: Enabling instant cross-chain settlements
- **Security**: Preserving blockchain-level protections

## Architecture

Yellow Network comprises three distinct layers:

1. **On-Chain Layer**: Smart contracts managing custody, dispute handling, and settlement
2. **Off-Chain Layer**: RPC protocol enabling rapid, gasless state synchronization
3. **Application Layer**: Custom business logic operating atop the protocol
